Linux Foobar2000 wrapper
========================

This is a script written in Bash to act as a wrapper for Foobar2000 when run under Wine on Linux.


What is it for?
===============

Foobar2000 is one of those applications that I really like on Windows, and want to use on Linux too. 
Fortunately, it is possible to run it on Linux via Wine. However, there are some issues that arise when 
you want to use it as your default music application, bind some events etc..

This script parses all the commands and runs them properly so that you can integrate foobar2000 with your 
Linux distribution easier.


Installation
============
